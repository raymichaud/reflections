When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you wanted to share the repository with others or if you wanted to maintain
    the repository from several PCs

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I'm not sure - I can't think of any scenarios at the moment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    You fork a repository from another GitHub user's repo to your own GitHub repo.
    You can clone a repo from any GitHub account to your local PC or from and to
    your own PC.
    You create a branch in a specific repo fix a bug or work on a feature to keep
    the master branch at production quality.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So that we can see what has been committed to the remote that may not have
    been pulled to our local reporitory.
