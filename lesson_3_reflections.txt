When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you wanted to share the repository with others or if you wanted to maintain
    the repository from several PCs

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I'm not sure - I can't think of any scenarios at the moment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    You fork a repository from another GitHub user's repo to your own GitHub repo.
    You can clone a repo from any GitHub account to your local PC or from and to
    your own PC.
    You create a branch in a specific repo fix a bug or work on a feature to keep
    the master branch at production quality.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So that we can see what has been committed to the remote that may not have
    been pulled to our local reporitory.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using a cloud based service like Google docs. It would be easier since we
    wouldn't need to learn command line but tracking changes and resolving conflicts
    would not be as easy.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Making changes in a seperate branch allows you to keep the master branch at
    production quality so that changes can be tested before being merged into the
    master branch.
